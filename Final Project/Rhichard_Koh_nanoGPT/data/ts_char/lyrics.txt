when she fell she fell apart cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk when she crashed her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fairweather friends  when she looked around her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices echoes she heard even in her sleep whatever you say it is not right whatever you do it is not enough your kindness is fake your pain is manipulative  when she lay there on the ground she dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something not just the idea of something  when she finally rose she rose slowly avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies wary of phone calls and promises charmers dandies and getlovequickschemes  when she stood she stood with a desolate knowingness waded out into the dark wild ocean up to her neck bathed in her brokenness said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed standing broadshouldered next to her was a love that was really something not just the idea of something  when she turned to go home she heard the echoes of new words may your heart remain breakable but never by the same hand twice and even louder without your past you could never have arrived so wondrously and brutally by design or some violent exquisite happenstance here  and in the death of her reputation she felt truly alive

heres something ive learned about people  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us we know our friend in a certain light but we dont know them the way their lover does just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend their mother knows them differently than their roommate who knows them differently than their colleague their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness and yet a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd nothing more we may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true we may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip  this is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet and together we will all discover the aftereffects of that ultimately we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us but then we wake up look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes and cringe we hope someday well meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future their partner their forever someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you  the point being despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify we are never just good or just bad we are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party existing somewhere between our welllit profile photo and our drivers license shot we are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity loyalty and selfpreservation pragmatism and impulsiveness ive been in the public eye since i was  years old on the beautiful lovely side of that ive been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving vibrant people on the other side of the coin my mistakes have been used against me my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment and my songwriting has been trivialized as oversharing  when this album comes out gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test there will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory because its  and if you didnt see a picture of it it couldnt have happened right  let me say it again louder for those in the back  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us  there will be no further explanation there will be just reputation

so over the years a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end how long does it take where do you write what are the circumstances do you start with music do you start with lyrics and my answer is always that it happens differently every time and thats why im still so in love with song writing so what ive done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways so ill explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how i put songs together  i sent this voice memo to ryan tedder because id always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time so i always wanna be prepared i wanted to send him the idea that i was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said i cant stand that i wanna work on something else think of something else so i just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where i wanted to go with the song how i saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called i know places so this was the voice memo i sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song  okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing  uhuhuhoh ohohohi ohohoh ohohohi ohohohoh ohohohiii  na na na na waiting at the back door theyre around and the vultures come around and you know that they wont they wont us say what they want bout say what they want bout us and you come and sing and listen i would not think about it but im not done every know that a thing or two about it thing or two about it i  cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run  baby i know some places we wont be found and theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down cause i i know places we can hide i know places i know places  uhuhuhi uhuhuhi ohohi uhuhuhi know places  or whatever i dont know but thats basically just like a dark really dark lyric like  thing and its about like everybodys like trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and its like you just whatever you know and the  would just go to that major and just be like ooh  so i hope you like it it wouldnt be a piano thing it would be like vocalizing like very like beat now im just making weird sounds hope you like it
 
and its a sad picture the final blow hits you somebody else gets what you wanted again and you know its all the same another time and place repeating history and youre getting sick of it but i believe in whatever you do and ill do anything to see it through   because these things will change can you feel it now these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down this revolution the time will come for us to finally win and well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah oh oh   so weve been outnumbered raided and now cornered its hard to fight when the fight aint fair were getting stronger now finding things they never found they might be bigger but were faster and never scared you can walk away say we dont need this but theres something in your eyes says we can beat this   cause these things will change can you feel it now these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down this revolution the time will come for us to finally win and well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah oh oh   tonight we stand get off our knees fight for what weve worked for all these years and the battle was long its the fight of our lives but well stand up champions tonight   it was the night things changed can you see it now these walls that they put up to hold us back fell down its a revolution throw your hands up cause we never gave in and well sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah hallelujah

when i found old diaries from my childhood and my teens they were covered in dust im not just saying that for poetic effect they were truly dusty with pictures drawn of first day of school outfits and inspirational quotes i used to retrace over and over to get me through doubtful moments id practice my autograph and tape my  picks to the pages in the entries i daydreamed on paper and mused about who might ask who to the dance or how nervous i was saying the national anthem at the local baseball game i frequently and drastically changed my opinions on love friends confidence and trust i vented described memories in detail jotted down new song ideas and questioned why i would ever try to shoot for a career i had such a small chance of ever attaining  but what shocked me the most was how often i wrote down the things i loved writing a new song riding in the car with my mom the purplepink skies of the soccer field  on the walk home the one night in middle school when none of my friends were fighting the dazzle of opal necklaces i couldnt afford gleaming from a department store jewelry case i wrote about tiny details in my life in these diaries from a bygone age with such wonderment intrigue romance i noticed things and decided they were romantic and so they were  in life we grow up and we encounter the nuanced complexities of trying to figure out who to be how to act or how to be happy like invisible smoke in the room we wonder what kind of anxiety pushes you forward and what kind ruins your ability to find joy in your life we constantly question our choices our surroundings and we beat ourselves up for our mistakes all the while we crave romance we long for those rare enchanting moments when things just fall into place above all else we really really want our lives to be filled with love  ive decided that in this life i want to be defined by the things i love not the things i hate the things im afraid of or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night those things may be struggles but theyre not my identity i wish the same for you may your struggles become inaudible background noise behind the loud clergies voices of those who love and appreciate you turn those voices up in the mix in your head may you take notice of the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even find wonderment in them may you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might kill you didnt i hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed i hope that if there is a lover in your life its someone who deserves you if thats the case i hope you treat them with care  this album is a love letter to love itself all the captivating spellbinding maddening devastating red blue gray golden aspects of it thats why there are so many songs in honor of fever dreams bad boys confessions of love on a drunken night out christmas lights still hanging in january  string scars on my hands false gods and blind faith memories of jumping into an icy outdoor pool creaks in floorboards and ultraviolet morning light finally finding a friend and opening the curtains to see the clearest brightest daylight after the darkest night  we are what we love this is lover

according to my birth certificate i turn  this year its weird because part of me still feels  and part of me feels  but the actual age i currently am is  ive heard people say that your thirties are the most fun so ill definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when i know but until then i thought id share some lessons ive learned before reaching  because its  and sharing is caring  lesson   i learned to block some of the noise social media can be great but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you arent how youre failing or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment one thing i do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments yes i keep comments off on my posts that way im showing my friends and fans updates on my life but im training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that i look  im also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to go die in a hole ho while im having my coffee at nine in the morning i think its healthy for your selfesteem to need less internet praise to appease it especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist an actual comment i received once  lesson   being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble while it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady this can contribute to some of your lifes worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you grow a backbone trust your gut and know when to strike back be like a snakeonly bite if someone steps on you  lesson   trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal it may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture you had to give me one moment of bitterness come on but that said its good to mess up and learn from it and take risks its especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching thats good well always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace no this is not an excuse to text your ex right now thats not what i said or do it whatever maybe youll learn from it then youll probably forget what you learned and do it again but its fine do you youre searching  lesson   i learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body i worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves shinier hair and more energy i think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting but taking it too far can be really dangerous there is no quick fix i work on accepting my body every day  lesson   banish the drama you only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it be discerning if someone in your life is hurting you draining you or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable blocking their number isnt cruel its just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it  lesson   ive learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us these messages tell women that we arent allowed to age its an impossible standard to meet and ive been loving how outspoken jameela jamil has been on this subject reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women were supposed to defy gravity time and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isnt even remotely required of men  lesson   my biggest fear after the manchester arena bombing and the vegas concert shooting i was completely terrified to go on tour this time because i didnt know how we were going to keep  million fans safe over seven months there was a tremendous amount of planning expense and effort put into keeping my fans safe my fear of violence has continued into my personal life i carry quikclot army grade bandage dressing which is for gunshot or stab wounds websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address ive ever had online you get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things every day i try to remind myself of the good in the world the love ive witnessed and the faith i have in humanity we have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears  lesson   i learned not to let outside opinions establish the value i place on my own life choices for too long the projected opinions of strangers affected how i viewed my relationships whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me or what they thought was couples goals based on a picture i posted on instagram that stuff isnt real for an approval seeker like me it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my own value system of what i actually want  lesson   i learned how to make some easy cocktails like pimms cups aperol spritzes oldfashioneds and mojitos because  lesson   ive always cooked a lot but i found three recipes i know ill be making at dinner parties for life ina gartens real meatballs and spaghetti i just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat nigella lawsons mughlai chicken and jamie olivers chicken fajitas with mol sauce getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer i also learned how to immediately calculate celsius to fahrenheit in my head which is what im pretty sure the internet would call a weird flex  lesson   recently i discovered command tape and i definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if id hung things that way all along this is not an ad i just really love command tape  lesson   apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you even if it was unintentional its so easy to just apologize and move on try not to say im sorry but and make excuses for yourself learn how to make a sincere apology and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships  lesson   its my opinion that in cases of sexual assault i believe the victim coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through i know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing awful experience i believe victims because i know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying this happened to me its something no one would choose for themselves we speak up because we have to and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we dont  lesson   when tragedy strikes someone you know in a way youve never dealt with before its okay to say that you dont know what to say sometimes just saying youre so sorry is all someone wants to hear its okay to not have any helpful advice to give them you dont have all the answers however its not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour your support is all someone needs when theyre at their lowest point even if you cant really help the situation its nice for them to know that you would if you could  lesson   vitamins make me feel so much better i take ltheanine which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety i also take magnesium for muscle health and energy  lesson   before you jump in headfirst maybe i dont knowget to know someone all that glitters isnt gold and first impressions actually arent everything its impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room but what i know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them i call it a solid first  but the layers of a person you discover in time are they honest selfaware and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it do they show up for you when you need them do they still love you after theyve seen you broken or after theyve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if theyre people these are things a first impression could never convey  lesson   after my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a sharpie as eyeliner do not do it i felt like i needed to start being nicer to my skin i now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after i shower not just in the winter but all year round because why cant i be soft during all the seasons  lesson   realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them for example never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me even as an adult i still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at in my twenties i found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend so i shouted it from the rooftops posted pictures and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood without realizing that other people might still feel the way i did when i felt so alone its important to address our longstanding issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them  lesson   playing mind games is for the chase in a real relationship or friendship youre shooting yourself in the foot if you dont tell the other person how you feel and what could be done to fix it no one is a mind reader if someone really loves you they want you to verbalize how you feel this is real life not chess  lesson   learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships something about were in our young twenties hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family and maybe they will be for the rest of your life or maybe theyll just be your comrades for an important phase but not forever its sad but sometimes when you grow you outgrow relationships you may leave behind friendships along the way but youll always keep the memories  lesson

it started with imagery visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity  stars drawn around scars a cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later battleships sinking into the ocean down down down the tree swing in the woods of my childhood hushed tones of lets run away and never doing it the sun drenched month of august sipped away like a bottle of wine a mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor a whiskey bottle beckoning hands held through plastic a single thread that for better or for worse ties you to your fate  pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters i found myself not only writing my own stories but also writing about or from the perspective of people ive never met people ive known or those i wish i hadnt an exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isnt his own wondering how it all went so terribly terribly wrong an embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession a seventeenyearold standing on a porch learning to apologize lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen high line my grandfather dean landing at guadalcanal in  a misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out  a tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around sometimes even sung about the lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible speculation over time becomes fact myths ghost stories and fables fairytales and parables gossip and legend someones secrets written in the sky for all to behold  in isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy history and memory ive told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love wonder and whimsy they deserve  now its up to you to pass them down

where will the music industry be in  years  years  years  before i tell you my thoughts on the matter you should know that youre reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dyingits just coming alive  there are many many people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity i am not one of them in my opinion the value of an album is and will continue to be based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work and the financial value that artists and their labels place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace piracy file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically and every artist has handled this blow differently  in recent years youve probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away for this promotion or that exclusive deal my hope for the future not just in the music industry but in every young girl i meetis that they all realize their worth and ask for it  music is art and art is important and rare important rare things are valuable valuable things should be paid for its my opinion that music should not be free and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an albums price point is i hope they dont underestimate themselves or undervalue their art  arrows through the heart  in mentioning album sales id like to point out that people are still buying albums but now theyre buying just a few of them they are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really arent alone in feeling so alone it isnt as easy today as it was  years ago to have a multiplatinumselling album and as artists that should challenge and motivate us  there are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in peoples lives forever the way i see it fans view music the way they view their relationships some music is just for fun a passing fling the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit that they will soon forget they ever danced to some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past  however some artists will be like finding the one we will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren as an artist this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans i think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond the one my father has with the beach boys and the one my mother has with carly simon  i think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise no i did not say shock i said surprise i believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other so why cant this love affair exist between an artist and their fans  in the youtube generation we live in i walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online to continue to show them something they had never seen before i brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me my generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient we want to be caught off guard delighted left in awe i hope the next generations artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes as challenging as that might be  there are a few things i have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years the first being autographs i havent been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iphone with a frontfacing camera the only memento kids these days want is a selfie its part of the new currency which seems to be how many followers you have on instagram  fan power  a friend of mine who is an actress told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses the casting director chose the actress with more twitter followers i see this becoming a trend in the music industry for me this dates back to  when i walked into my first recordlabel meetings explaining to them that i had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called myspace in the future artists will get record deals because they have fansnot the other way around  another theme i see fading into the gray is genre distinction these days nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence the wild unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes pop sounds like hip hop country sounds like rock rock sounds like soul and folk sounds like countryand to me thats incredible progress i want to make music that reflects all of my influences and i think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a careerdefining path and more of an organizational tool  this moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless in this moment in music stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded and sonic evolution is not only acceptedit is celebrated the only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all  celebrity spotlight  i predict that some things will never change there will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians especially the younger ones artists who were at their commercial peak in the s s and s tell me it was never this crazy for us back then and i suspect ill be saying that same thing to younger artists someday god help them there continues to be a bad girl vs good girlcleancut vs sexy debate and for as long as those labels exist i just hope there will be contenders on both sides everyone needs someone to relate to  and as for me ill just be sitting back and growing old watching all of this happen or not happen all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism  and id also like a nice garden
 
my momma stood across the room face to face but never eye to eye recalling words we said the battle that we swore wed never fight breaking pieces off with every lie a tear came to her eye and she said   dont walk away now and dont rip my heart out dont you block me out tonight honey where are you and dont hate me for loving you   he walked around my life and made blind with every single move he caught me staring at him mad about him little that i knew love is different when you play the fool and all i want to do is say   dont walk away now and dont rip my heart out dont you make cry tonight like you always do and dont hate me for loving you   i slammed the door sat on the floor cried into my bed said are you there do you even care to cross above my head but someone said   dont turn away now and dont rip my heart out things are meant to happen like this i know its right for you and dont hate me for loving you   i looked up at the sky face to face and finally eye to eye

heres to the tour that taught me that your real friends really dont care about the he saidshe said heres to the moments when weve forgotten all about the things that scare us the things were insecure about and in spite of them we jumped around together under flashing lights fireworks and confetti  to the times i learned by watching you sing along to every song that my greatest triumph in life has been finding the ones who like me for me and that even in your worst times they can see the best in you  heres to the musical family i get to share the stage with and all the things theyve sacrificed in their lives to be able to sing play and dance as well as they do heres to our extraordinary crew and the days they spend away from the ones they love so that we can stand under the lights and play for you heres to the people who work at these stadiums and help clean up the glitter on the floor after the party  heres to getting smarter and harder in the nick of time but still remaining delicate enough to care deeply for the ones you can trust and brave enough to stay when its hard or its wrong or were making mistakes heres to life teaching us lessons and us learning growing dancing and changing together everything ive learned about a reputation and how little it really means when defined by those who do not know you ive learned from the fans whose spirits lit up these stadiums  thanks to you im doing better than i ever was  love taylor
 
spoken writing the song lover was one of those magical experiences that you sometimes get to have as a songwriter um i wrote it really quick in the middle of the night as soon as i wrote it i knew i wanted it to be the album title and i knew that writing it kinda would depict the tone of the entire record so it was a real catalyst for what this album turned into and i wrote it alone so i wanted to go in and play it for jack antonoff who i knew who would be the perfect person to produce it and so i walked into the studio and i sat in the piano and this is what happened  so it is its basically i dont see it as a piano i think its that like kinda of dreamy y throwback but not like camp throwback so   sung we could leave the christmas lights up til january this is our place we make the rules and theres a dazzling haze a mysterious way about you dear have i known you  seconds or  years  can i go where you go can we always be this close forever and ever and ah take me out take me home youre my my my my lover  spoken yeah i love the walk down i love the walk down i was trying to figure out what the hell is gonna happen there so the so  sung my my my my lover  we could let our friends crash on the couches this is our place we make the call and im highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you ive loved you three summers now honey but i want em all  can i go where you go can we always be this close forever and ever and ah take me out and take me home youre my my my my lover  spoken okay and then i have this  thing thats um essentially well no i was i did i did it in this key but it could be this thing like a key change  so it plays off of the walk downish but its this is the melody of it it goes its like  sung ladies and gentlemen will you please stand with every  string scar on my hands i take this magnetic force oh fuck i take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover my hearts been borrowed and yours has been blue alls well that ends well to end up with you swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover and youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me  spoken wait so goes like  sung and youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me and at every table ill save you a seat  spoken so goes and you it goes  sung and youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me my hearts been borrowed your hearts been blue alls well that ends well to end up with you swear to be overdramatic swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover and youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me and at every table ill save you a seat  spoken you like yeah ive never i never do these cords but i was really at the piano like hashing it out yesterday

radio dj hey a little bit ago we were talking about uh songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next in the countdown is taylor swift and have you heard this song yet  tim mcgraw i have heard this song  radio dj tim mcgraw and what what did you think the first time you heard it or how was the first time  tim mcgraw it was awesome uh except for i didnt know if i should i should take it as a compliment or i should feel old  radio dj ah ha ha ha  tim mcgraw i didnt know which one but the more the more i hear it the more i dont know if its true or not but i start taking it as a compliment and not that i feel that im old i dont know if thats true but thats what i choose to think  radio dj why dont we find out taylor is a compliment or uh hes old  taylor swift oh its definitely a compliment yeah laughing  radio dj tim mcgraw meet taylor swift  tim mcgraw nice  taylor swift nice to meet you  tim mcgraw nice to meet you taylor how you doing  taylor swift im doing great how are you doing  tim mcgraw im doing good congratulations on your record its doing great  taylor swift thank you so much im just so excited thank you for uh having good music and everything i swear im not a stalker laughing  radio dj well  taylor swift the funny thing about this song is ya know as a writer some of the songs that you write like four hours youll do them writing a song and itll be good and everything but i wrote this one in literally  minutes and ya know i really didnt think anything about calling in tim mcgraw so i kinda shelved it for like three months and never even thought that it was going to be a single but um my label heard it and was like were putting that outlaughing  tim mcgraw well im glad ya did cause um its doing well for ya  radio dj so i so i understand that you two guys have not talked  tim mcgraw no  radio dj you havent met  tim mcgraw no  taylor swift no weve never talked or met or anything  tim mcgraw i sent her a message one time i think with entertainment weekly or something like that oh i dont remember what show it was i was doing an interview and they were going to interview taylor the next day so i sent her a little message so i dont know if she got it or not  taylor swift oh my god they never gave that to me  tim mcgraw they didnt okay well there ya go i did laughing  radio dj so ii  taylor swift weve just officially never never talked or messaged or anything  tim mcgraw not at all  radio dj so i thought i think its pretty brave to put out a song called tim mcgraw without maybe talking to tim mcgraw did you mind  taylor swift it was definitely kind of a chance ya know i didnt say anything bad in the song so i was kinda thinking ya know he wouldnt take it too bad  tim mcgraw well thank you for that thank you for not saying anything bad im sure theres plenty that couldve been said tell me  taylor swift could you tell faith that i said hello  tim mcgraw i sure will i sure will and she loves the song too by the way  taylor swift oh my gosh shes awesome  tim mcgraw i agree  radio dj this thistell me about writing a song um did this did this really happen  taylor swift well yeah i mean i never really kinda went into this writing session on im gonna write a song called tim mcgraw um yeah because that would just be weird but um laughing i actually this this is kinda strange but i actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school  tim mcgraw now i feel old  taylor swift and um i was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and i was going through a period where i was dating this guy that was going off to college and i knew we were gonna break up so i started to think about all the things that i knew would remind him of me and its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are tim mcgraw songs they just are  tim mcgraw aww thank you  taylor swift and uh you know so i kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this cowriter who was kinda wondering if i was crazy or not but it turned out alright and ya know the funny thing is that i shelved this song for like three months and never never even played it for anybody never even demoed it and uh then one time i was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes well thats your first single laughing  taylor swift and im like well  tim mcgraw well you can write songs about me anytime taylor laughing  taylor

it was painted red the stripe was white it was  feet from bow to stern light secondhand from a dealer in atlanta i rode up with daddy when he went there to get her we put on a shine put on a motor built out of love and made for the water ran her for years until the transom got rotten a piece of my childhood will never be forgotten   it was just an old plywood boat  johnson and an electric choke a young girl two hands on the wheel i cant replace the way it made me feel and i would turn her sharp i would make it whine hed say you cant beat the way a old wood boat rides just a little lake across the alabama line but i was king of the ocean when daddy let me drive   just an old half ton short bed ford my uncle bought new in  daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking a couple burnt valves and he had it going hed let me drive her when we haul off a load down a dirt strip wed haul trash off of thigpen road id sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals smiling like a hero who just received his medal   it was just an old handmedown ford with  speed on the column and a dent in the door a young girl two hands on the wheel i cant replace the way it made me feel and i would press that clutch and i would keep it right he would say a little slower girl youre doing just fine just a dirt road with trash on each side but i was mario andretti when daddy let me drive   soon ill be grown up with daughters of my own i let them drive my old jeep across the pasture at our home maybe one day theyll reach back in their file and pull out that old memory and think of me and smile and say   it was just an old worn out jeep rusty old floor boards hot on my feet a young girl two hands on the wheel i cant replace the way it made me feel and hed say steer it left and turn it right straighten up girl now youre doing just fine just a little valley by the river where wed ride but i was high on a mountain when daddy let me drive oh he let me drive oh he let me drive   its just an old plywood boat with a  johnson and electric choke

i remember the eyes of the kid in the crowd who cut me down to size realizing is crying out loud for every kid on stage theres a kid in the crowd
 
we were both young when i first saw you i close my eyes and the flashback starts im standing there on a balcony in summer air see the lights see the party the ball gowns see you make your way through the crowd and say hello little did i know  pre  that you were romeo you were throwing pebbles and my daddy said stay away from juliet and i was crying on the staircase begging you please dont go and i said    romeo take me somewhere we can be alone ill be waiting all thers left to do is run youll be the princ and ill be the princess its a love story baby just say yes   so i sneak out to the garden to see you we keep quiet cause were dead if they knew so close your eyes escape this town for a little while  pre  cause you were romeo i was a scarlet letter and my daddy said stay away from juliet but you were everything to me i was begging you please dont go and i said    romeo take me somewhere we can be alone ill be waiting all theres left to do is run youll be the prince and ill be the princess its a love story baby just say yes romeo save me theyre trying to tell me how to feel this love is difficult but its real dont be afraid well make it out of this mess its a love story baby just say yes oh oh   i got tired of waiting wondering if you were ever coming around my faith in you was fading when i met you on the outskirts of town and i said romeo save me ive been feeling so alone i keep waiting for you but you never come is this in my head i dont know what to think he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said    marry me juliet youll never have to be alone i love you and thats all i really know i talked to your dad go pick out a white dress its a love story baby just say yes   oh oh oh oh cause we were both young when i first saw you
 
my favorite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more than just tell you a story they do more than just set the scene or paint the picture the writing i love the most places you into that story that room that rain soaked kiss you can smell the air hear the sounds and feel your heart race as the characters does its something f scott fitzgerald did so well to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment  im highly biased but i think that the way music can transport you back to a longforgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time to this day when i hear cowboy take me away by the dixie chicks i instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in pennsylvania im clutching a  and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house when i hear i write sins not tragedies by panic at the disco im transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of hendersonville tennessee with my best friend abigail euphorically screaming the lyrics when i hear how to save a life by the fray breathe am by anna nalick or the story by brandi carlile i immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end when id get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew i would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room  just being alone with those songs those are all from the greys anatomy soundtrack my commitment to that show truly knows no bounds im convinced that you learn by alanis morissette put your records on by corinne bailey rae and why by annie lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs   i love writing songs because i love preserving memories like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had i like to use nostalgia as inspiration when im writing songs for the same reason i like to take photographs i like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times i want to remember the color of the sweater the temperature of the air the creak of the floorboards the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever  the fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of i thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being well universal youd think that as pop writers were supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to so youd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic and yet the ones i think cut through the most are actually the most detailed and i dont mean in a shakespearean sonnet type of way although i love shakespeare as much as the next girl obviously see love story   in modern pop songsbopschunes including extremely personal details like kiki do you love me and baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover have been breaking through on the most global cultural level this year on tour i got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from cuba singing about havana  i think these days people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to we like being confided in and hearing someone say this is what i went through as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles we actually do not want our pop music to be generic i think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive this glimpse into the artists story invites us to connect it to our own and in the best case scenario allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories its this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal or made us cry dance or escape that truly stands the test of time just like a great book

my love was as cruel as the cities i lived in everyone looked worse in the light there are so many lines that ive crossed unforgiven ill tell you the truth but never goodbye   i dont wanna look at anything else now that i saw you i dont wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you been sleeping so long in a twentyyear dark night but now i see daylight i only see daylight   luck of the draw only draws the unlucky so i became the butt of the joke i wounded the good and i trusted the wicked clearing the air i breathed in the smoke maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down maybe ive stormed out of every single room in this town threw out our cloaks and our daggers because its morning now its brighter now now   i dont wanna look at anything else now that i saw you i can never look away i dont wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you things im never gonna say been sleeping so long in a twentyyear dark night now im wide awake but now i see daylight i only see daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight   and i can still see it all in my mind all of you all of me intertwined i once believed love would be black and white but its golden golden and i can still see it all in my head back and forth from new york sneaking in your bed i once believed love would be burning red but its golden like daylight like daylight like daylight like daylight   i dont wanna look at anything else now that i saw you i can never look away i dont wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you things im never gonna say been sleeping so long in a twentyyear dark night now im wide awake but now i see daylight i only see daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight   you gotta step into the daylight and let it go just let it go let it go

i used to rule the world seas would rise when i gave the word now in the morning i sleep alone sweep the streets i used to own  i used to roll the dice feel the fear in my enemys eyes listen as the crowd would sing now the old king is dead long live the king  one minute i held the keys next the doors were closed on me and i discovered that my castles stand upon pillars of salt pillars of sand  i hear jerusalem bells aringing roman cavalry choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and shield my missionaries in a foreign field  for some reason i cant explain once you go there was never never an honest word but that was when i ruled the world  it was a wicked and wild wind blew down the doors to let me in shattered windows and the sound of drums people couldnt believe what id become  revolutionaries wait for my head on a silver plate just a puppet on a lonely string oh who would ever wanna be king  i hear jerusalem bells aringing roman cavalry choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and shield my missionaries in a foreign field  for some reason i cant explain i know saint peter wont call my name never an honest word but that was when i ruled the world  for some reason i cant explain i know saint peter wont call my name never an honest word but that was when i ruled the world

is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me im not cut out for all these cynical clones these hunters with cell phones   take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die i dont belong and my beloved neither do you those windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry im setting off but not without my muse   what should be over burrowd under my skin in heartstopping waves of hurt iv come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze tell me what are my words worth   take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die i dont belong and my beloved neither do you those windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry im setting off but not without my muse   i want auroras and sad prose i want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet cause i havent moved in years and i want you right here a red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground with no one around to tweet it while i bathe in cliffside pools with my calamitous love and insurmountable grief   take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die i dont belong and my beloved neither do you those windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry im setting off but not without my muse no not without you no not without you

jameela jamil presents swift with her award  absolutely love this one right this is sort of a its not a short speech so just i dont want this to slip and break cause its very important to me  jamil takes the award from swift to hold  thank you so much shes so supportive we all need someone like that im taylor good evening i wanna first thank billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for   microphone stand lowers  whoa this is going great so far excellent okay i wanna say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade so what does it mean to be the woman of this decade well it means ive seen a lot when this decade began i was  years old and i had put out my selftitled debut album when i was  and then the album that would become my breakthrough album which was called fearless and i saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that i was really curious about i saw pop stations send my songs love story and you belong with me to number one for the first time  and i saw that as a female in this industry some people will always have slight reservations about you whether you deserve to be there whether your male producer or cowriter is the reason for your success or whether it was a savvy record label it wasnt i saw that people love to explain away a womans success in the music industry and i saw something in me change due to this realization this was the decade when i became a mirror for my detractors whatever they decided i couldnt do is exactly what i did  audience claps  huh ill take it thanks whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems and the best lyrical examples i can think of are songs like mean shake it off and blank space basically if people had something to say about me i usually said something back in my own way and this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics when fearless did win album of the year at the grammys and i did become the youngest  artist to ever win the award with that win came criticism and backlash in  that id never experienced before as a young new artist all of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice was it strong enough was i a little bit pitchy all of a sudden they werent sure if i was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past i had had cowriters in the room  at that time i couldnt understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard i believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash which is clever you gotta give it to them and now i realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond peoples comfort level i now have come to expect that with good news comes some sort of pushback but i didnt know that then  so then i decided that i would be the only songwriter on my third album speak now and that i would tour constantly work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show i decided i would be what they said i couldnt be i didnt know then that soon enough people would decide on something else i wasnt quite doing right and then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and i would keep accommodating overcorrecting in an effort to appease my critics  theyre saying im dating too much in my twenties okay ill stop ill just be single for years now theyre saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs okay ill make one about moving to new york and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends oh theyre saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music alright okay heres an entire genre shift and a pop album called   audience cheers  oh you heard it sick now its that im showing you too many pictures of me with my friends okay i can stop doing that too now im actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart businesswoman okay ill disappear from public view for years now im being cast as a villain to you okay heres an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere  in the last ten years i have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked at for their bodies their romantic lives their fashion or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist i really like his songs but i dont know what it is theres just something about him i dont like no that criticism is reserved for us but you know ive learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art ive watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade lana del rey was ruthly criticized   someone in the audience cheers  yes yeah thank you we have similar tastes i like it she was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into in my opinion the most influential artist in pop her vocal stylings her lyrics her aesthetics theyve been echoed and repurposed in every corner in music and this year her incredible album is nominated for album of the year at the grammys because she just kept making art and that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion that we shouldnt let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us  and i see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work i absolutely love i see it in lizzo rosala tayla parx hayley kiyoko king princess camila cabello halsey megan thee stallion princess nokia nina nesbitt sigrid normani her maggie rogers becky g dua lipa ella mai billie eilish and so many other amazing women who are making music right now  female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth streaming record and ticket sales and critical acclaim so why are we doing so well because we have to grow fast we have to work this hard we have to prove that we deserve this and we have to top our last achievements women in music onstage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast we are held at a higher sometimes impossiblefeeling standard and it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it it seems like the pressure that couldve crushed us made us into diamonds instead and what didnt kill us actually did make us stronger but we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in ar meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room  audience cheers  we now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasnt around last decade and that is the streaming world in music were always walking handinhand with technology and sometimes that is so awesome like how now were able to just drop a song that we made yesterday ive spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes i still dont think that record contracts or producers agreements have fully caught up and i hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers songwriters and creators dont you  audience claps  lately theres been a new shift that has affected me personally and that i feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry and as your resident loud person i feel the need to bring it up and that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate as if its an app or a shoe line this just happened to me without my approval consultation or consent after i was denied the chance to purchase my music outright my entire catalogue was sold to scooter brauns ithaca holdings in a deal that im told was funded by the soros family  capital and the carlyle group  yet to this day none of these investors have ever bothered to contact me or my team directly to perform their due diligence on their investment on their investment in me to ask how i might feel about the new owner of my art the music i wrote the videos i created photos of me my handwriting my album designs and of course scooter never contacted me or my team to discuss it prior to the sale or even when it was announced  im fairly certain he knew how i would feel about it though and let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying but hes always been nice to me when im raising valid concerns about artists and their right to own their music and of course hes nice to you if youre in this room you have something he needs the fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think according to his own social media post that he could buy me but im obviously not going willingly  yet the most amazing thing was to discover that it would be the women in our industry who would have my back and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times and i will never ever forget it like ever  audience laughs  but to conclude i will say that in ten years ive seen forward steps in our industry in our awareness our inclusion our ability to start calling out unfairness and misconduct ive seen the advent of social media the way it can boost the breakthrough of emerging artists and ive seen fans become more engaged and supportive than ever before ive leaned on that support and it has kept me in a place where no matter what i always wanted to keep making music for them  i was up on a stage in new york city in  accepting billboard woman of the year and i was talking about the future of streaming how we needed to make sure that the female artists writers and producers of the next generation were protected and compensated fairly this was before my record deal with universal last year that would contractually guarantee that the artists on their roster be paid upon any sale of their spotify shares unrecupable so thank you for that  audience cheers  this speech im referring to was on my th birthday im about to turn thirty tonight woo but my exact quote during this speech was i really just feel like we need to continue to try to offer something to a younger generation of musicians because somewhere right now your future woman of the year is probably sitting in a piano lesson or in a girls choir and today right now we need to take care of her ive since learned that at that exact moment an year old girl in california really was taking piano lessons and really was in a girls choir and this year she has been named woman of the year at the age of seventeen her name is billie  audience cheers  and those are the stories we need to think about every day as we do our jobs in this industry the ones where peoples dreams come true and they get to create music and play it for people the ones where fans feel a connection to music that makes their day easier makes their night more fun makes their love feel more sacred or their heartache feel less isolating the ones where all of you in this room stand as an example for someone else in the next generation who loves the same thing that we love music and no matter what else enters the conversation we will bring it back to music  and as for me lately ive been focusing less on doing what they say i cant do and more on doing whatever the hell i want thank you for a magnificent happy free confused sometimes lonely but mostly golden decade im honored to be here tonight i feel very lucky to be with you thank you so much

i write this to explain why ill be holding back my album  from the new streaming service apple music i feel this deserves an explanation because apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans i respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries  im sure you are aware that apple music will be offering a free  month trial to anyone who signs up for the service im not sure you know that apple music will not be paying writers producers or artists for those three months i find it to be shocking disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company  this is not about me thankfully i am on my fifth album and can support myself my band crew and entire management team by playing live shows this is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success this is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt this is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create just like the innovators and creators at apple are pioneering in their fieldbut will not get paid for a quarter of a years worth of plays on his or her songs  these are not the complaints of a spoiled petulant child these are the echoed sentiments of every artist writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect apple so much we simply do not respect this particular call  i realize that apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming i think that is beautiful progress we know how astronomically successful apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists writers and producers for the  month trial period even if it is free for the fans trying it out  three months is a long time to go unpaid and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing i say this with love reverence and admiration for everything else apple has done i hope that soon i can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music i think this could be the platform that gets it right  but i say to apple with all due respect its not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this we dont ask you for free iphones please dont ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation  taylor

im writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on november th in which ill be voting in the state of tennessee in the past ive been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years i feel very differently about that now i always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights i believe we all deserve in this country i believe in the fight for lgbtq rights and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is wrong i believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying sickening and prevalent  i cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for all americans no matter their skin color gender or who they love running for senate in the state of tennessee is a woman named marsha blackburn as much as i have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office i cannot support marsha blackburn her voting record in congress appalls and terrifies me she voted against equal pay for women she voted against the reauthorization of the violence against women act which attempts to protect women from domestic violence stalking and date rape she believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples she also believes they should not have the right to marry these are not my tennessee values i will be voting for phil bredesen for senate and jim cooper for house of representatives please please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values for a lot of us we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree  on every issue but we have to vote anyway  so many intelligent thoughtful selfpossessed people have turned  in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count but first you need to register which is quick and easy to do october th is the last day to register to vote in the state of tn go to voteorg and you can find all the info happy voting

im writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on november th in which ill be voting in the state of tennessee in the past ive been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years i feel very differently about that now i always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights i believe we all deserve in this country i believe in the fight for lgbtq rights and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is wrong i believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying sickening and prevalent i cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for all americans no matter their skin color gender or who they love running for senate in the state of tennessee is a woman named marsha blackburn as much as i have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office i cannot support marsha blackburn her voting record in congress appalls and terrifies me she voted against equal pay for women she voted against the reauthorization of the violence against women act which attempts to protect women from domestic violence stalking and date rape she believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples she also believes they should not have the right to marry these are not my tennessee values i will be voting for phil bredesen for senate and jim cooper for house of representatives please please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values for a lot of us we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree  on every issue but we have to vote anyway so many intelligent thoughtful selfpossessed people have turned  in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count but first you need to register which is quick and easy to do october th is the last day to register to vote in the state of tn go to voteorg and you can find all the info happy voting

im curled up in my mothers bed staring intently at my laptop im watching a video of a familiarlooking man wearing a black tuxedo the video seems to be of a televised award show the tape is grainy but the man steps up to the mic and his words are clear  now im gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand her voice is full like solid gold with some platinum blended in sometimes youll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes but gold is brendas metal in this song i wish id wrote ladies and gentlemen brenda lee  the camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties the music starts and shes looking down at a framed picture shes at ease she is theatrical and she is beautiful in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye lights camera action she starts to sing thats when you hear the gold and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand the performance ends and the crowd goes wild the lovely lady graciously takes a bow she smiles out into the vast darkness taking it all in with grace and composure the video ends and i reflect back on what i just saw it was a timeless performance but here are the facts the year is  the song is someone loves you honey the man in the tuxedo is johnny cash and the woman in the beautiful dress with the honeylike voice is none other than brenda lee  brenda lee who was born in  near atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father brenda lee the little girl who took over the music world with charttopping hits when she was still a child brenda lee the woman who ushered in a new style of rock  roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television brenda lee the artist who later went back to her country roots proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under brenda lee the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her  i watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause theres a reason shes been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years brenda lee is grace brenda lee is class and composure and when she hears the roar of a crowd brenda lee smiles like shes five years old and receiving her first standing ovation brenda lee is someone i will always look up to because of the way she shines as johnny cash said in  its almost like shes golden

to put it plainly we just couldnt stop writing songs to try and put it more poetically it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music we chose to wander deeper in ive never done this before in the past ive always treated albums as oneoff eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released there was something different with folklore in making it i felt less like i was departing and more like i was returning i loved the escapism i found in these imaginarynot imaginary tales i loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your lives so i just kept writing them
