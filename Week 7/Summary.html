<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>In this module, we explored the foundational concepts of sequence models and Generative AI, which have become transformative in natural language processing, computer vision, and other AI applications. We focused on the evolution of sequence models and the challenges faced by earlier approaches, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. These traditional models, though essential, faced limitations in handling long-range dependencies and scaling effectively with large datasets. This paved the way for the development of transformer models, which brought significant improvements to the field by leveraging self-attention mechanisms.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>In the next module, we will take a deeper dive into the architecture of transformers, focusing specifically on the encoder-decoder structure and its components. This will include detailed explanations of the encoder's and decoder's roles, the self-attention layers, and the mechanisms that enable transformers to handle complex language processing tasks effectively. This exploration will provide insights into how transformers not only analyze but also generate content, making them powerful tools in the landscape of modern AI applications.</p>
