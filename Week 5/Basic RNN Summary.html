<h1>Training RNNs: Relevance and Applications</h1>
<h2>Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</h2>
<p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network designed for processing sequential data by maintaining a memory of previous inputs. This memory allows RNNs to consider the order and context of information, making them highly effective for tasks where data points are interconnected, such as language modeling, time-series forecasting, and speech recognition.</p>
<h2>Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)</h2>
<p>Training RNNs involves an adaptation of traditional backpropagation called Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). BPTT unrolls the RNN over time steps, allowing the network to learn dependencies between sequential data points by updating weights across these steps. However, this method presents challenges, including vanishing and exploding gradients, which impact the network's ability to learn long-term dependencies. Techniques like gradient clipping and using advanced RNN structures (e.g., LSTMs and GRUs) help address these issues.</p>
<h2>Importance of RNNs in Today’s AI Landscape</h2>
<p>With the rise of advanced language models like ChatGPT, RNNs’ ability to process sequential data has paved the way for more sophisticated architectures, like Transformers. While RNNs were once the foundation for language modeling, Transformers have now surpassed them in handling vast amounts of text data due to their parallel processing capabilities. Nonetheless, RNNs remain foundational in understanding how AI processes sequential information, and they continue to be relevant in applications that benefit from a focus on localized dependencies, such as real-time data processing.</p>

<p>This video provides a clear overview of RNNs, covering their architecture, challenges, and significance in deep learning. It serves as an excellent resource for revisiting the foundational concepts behind sequence modeling.</p>
<!-- What to Read Next Section -->
<h2>What to Expect Next</h2>
<p>In the upcoming modules, we’ll build upon the foundational understanding of RNNs to explore advanced techniques that overcome RNN limitations, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). These architectures will demonstrate how AI models can better retain context over extended sequences, addressing challenges like vanishing gradients.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll look at Transformers, which have revolutionized language models by enabling parallel processing of sequence data. Transformers allow us to handle massive text datasets, supporting today’s AI-driven applications like ChatGPT and other language models. The goal of these sections is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how sequence modeling has evolved and how each innovation builds towards more efficient, contextually aware AI systems.</p>
