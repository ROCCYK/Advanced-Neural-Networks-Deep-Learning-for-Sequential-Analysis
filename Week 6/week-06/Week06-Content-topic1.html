<section>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this module is to explore the architecture and mechanics of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and how they address the limitations of traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). By the end of this module, learners will understand the design of LSTM cells, the role of cell states and hidden states, and the advantages of LSTMs in managing long-term dependencies in sequential data.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>1. Background and Theory of LSTM Networks</h2>
<p>LSTM networks are an advanced type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to overcome limitations in traditional RNNs, particularly the vanishing gradient problem and difficulty in retaining long-term dependencies. LSTMs introduce a memory cell and gates to control information flow, allowing the network to retain important information across long sequences.</p>
<p>You can see more about LSTM <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/03/introduction-to-long-short-term-memory-lstm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is LSTM? Introduction to Long Short-Term Memory</a></p>
<div class="section">
<h3>What is the Vanishing Gradient Problem?</h3>
<p>In traditional RNNs, gradients diminish as they are backpropagated over many time steps, leading the model to "forget" information from earlier steps. This makes RNNs inefficient for tasks where long-term dependencies are important.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<h2>2. Detailed Architecture of LSTM Cells</h2>
<p>LSTM cells include a memory cell and three types of gates: the forget gate, input gate, and output gate. These gates allow the network to add or remove information from the memory cell as needed, effectively maintaining relevant information over long sequences.</p>
<br>
<h3><img alt="../_images/lstm-0.svg" src="https://d2l.ai/_images/lstm-0.svg" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></h3>
<h3>The above figure shows the simplified architecture of LSTMs.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px;">(Src:<a href="https://d2l.ai/chapter_recurrent-modern/lstm.html">https://d2l.ai/chapter_recurrent-modern/lstm.html</a>)</span></h3>
<h3>Forget Gate</h3>
<p>The forget gate decides which information from the previous cell state should be discarded. It is calculated as:</p>
<div class="formula">f<sub>t</sub> = σ(W<sub>f</sub>[h<sub>t-1</sub>, x<sub>t</sub>] + b<sub>f</sub>)</div>
<p>Here, <code>σ</code> represents the sigmoid function, and <code>W<sub>f</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>f</sub></code> are the weights and bias for the forget gate.</p>
<h3>Input Gate</h3>
<p>The input gate decides which new information should be added to the cell state. It consists of two parts: a sigmoid function to decide which values to update and a <code>tanh</code> function to create new candidate values.</p>
<div class="formula">i<sub>t</sub> = σ(W<sub>i</sub>[h<sub>t-1</sub>, x<sub>t</sub>] + b<sub>i</sub>)<br>Ć<sub>t</sub> = tanh(W<sub>c</sub>[h<sub>t-1</sub>, x<sub>t</sub>] + b<sub>c</sub>)</div>
<h3>Output Gate</h3>
<p>The output gate controls what the next hidden state will be. This hidden state is used for predictions or passed to the next cell.</p>
<div class="formula">o<sub>t</sub> = σ(W<sub>o</sub>[h<sub>t-1</sub>, x<sub>t</sub>] + b<sub>o</sub>)<br>h<sub>t</sub> = o<sub>t</sub> * tanh(C<sub>t</sub>)</div>
</section>
<section>
<h2>3. Cell State and Hidden State</h2>
<p>The cell state <code>C<sub>t</sub></code> acts as the "memory" of the LSTM, allowing information to be carried forward across long time steps. The hidden state <code>h<sub>t</sub></code> is the output of the LSTM cell at each time step, passed to the next cell along with the cell state.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3>How LSTMs Mitigate the Vanishing Gradient Problem</h3>
<p>By using a memory cell with gates to control the flow of information, LSTMs are able to preserve important information over long sequences, effectively reducing the impact of vanishing gradients. The gradients can be preserved over multiple time steps, making LSTMs more effective for tasks requiring long-term memory.</p>
</div>

<h2>4. Implementing LSTMs in PyTorch</h2>
<p>PyTorch provides an easy-to-use <code>torch.nn.LSTM</code> module for building LSTM networks. Below is an example of a basic LSTM implementation in PyTorch.</p>
<div class="formula">
<pre>import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        out = self.fc(out[-1])
        return out

# Example usage
model = SimpleLSTM(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, output_size=1)
x = torch.randn(5, 1, 10)  # (sequence_length, batch_size, input_size)
output = model(x)
print(output)
            </pre>

<h2>7. Worked-Out Numerical Examples of LSTM Gates and Cell State Computations</h2>
<p>This section provides step-by-step numerical examples to illustrate how each gate functions within the LSTM cell. Using hypothetical values, we will calculate the outputs of the forget, input, and output gates, as well as the resulting cell and hidden states.</p>
<h3>Forget Gate</h3>
<p>Suppose the values are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>W<sub>f</sub> = [0.2, 0.4]</code></li>
<li><code>h<sub>t-1</sub> = [0.5]</code></li>
<li><code>x<sub>t</sub> = [0.3]</code></li>
<li><code>b<sub>f</sub> = [0.1]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Calculation for <code>f<sub>t</sub></code>:</p>
<div class="formula">f<sub>t</sub> = σ((0.2 * 0.5) + (0.4 * 0.3) + 0.1) = σ(0.36) ≈ 0.59</div>
<p>The forget gate output is <code>f<sub>t</sub> = 0.59</code>, meaning 59% of the previous cell state is retained.</p>
<h3>Input Gate</h3>
<p>Assume the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>W<sub>i</sub> = [0.3, 0.6]</code></li>
<li><code>b<sub>i</sub> = [0.2]</code></li>
<li><code>W<sub>c</sub> = [0.4, 0.5]</code></li>
<li><code>b<sub>c</sub> = [0.3]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Calculation for <code>i<sub>t</sub></code>:</p>
<div class="formula">i<sub>t</sub> = σ((0.3 * 0.5) + (0.6 * 0.3) + 0.2) = σ(0.59) ≈ 0.64</div>
<p>Calculation for <code>Ć<sub>t</sub></code> (candidate cell state):</p>
<div class="formula">Ć<sub>t</sub> = tanh((0.4 * 0.5) + (0.5 * 0.3) + 0.3) = tanh(0.65) ≈ 0.57</div>
<p>The input gate output is <code>i<sub>t</sub> = 0.64</code> and candidate cell state is <code>Ć<sub>t</sub> = 0.57</code>.</p>
<h3>Output Gate</h3>
<p>Given the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>W<sub>o</sub> = [0.2, 0.5]</code></li>
<li><code>h<sub>t-1</sub> = [0.5]</code></li>
<li><code>x<sub>t</sub> = [0.3]</code></li>
<li><code>b<sub>o</sub> = [0.1]</code></li>
<li>Cell state <code>C<sub>t</sub> = 0.6</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Calculation for <code>o<sub>t</sub></code>:</p>
<div class="formula">o<sub>t</sub> = σ((0.2 * 0.5) + (0.5 * 0.3) + 0.1) = σ(0.35) ≈ 0.59</div>
<p>Final calculation for the hidden state <code>h<sub>t</sub></code>:</p>
<div class="formula">h<sub>t</sub> = o<sub>t</sub> * tanh(C<sub>t</sub>) ≈ 0.59 * tanh(0.6) ≈ 0.59 * 0.537 ≈ 0.317</div>
<p>The hidden state <code>h<sub>t</sub> ≈ 0.317</code> and output gate result <code>o<sub>t</sub> ≈ 0.59</code>.</p>
<h3>Complete Cell and Hidden State Update Example</h3>
<p>Using previous calculations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forget gate <code>f<sub>t</sub> = 0.59</code></li>
<li>Input gate <code>i<sub>t</sub> = 0.64</code></li>
<li>Candidate cell state <code>Ć<sub>t</sub> = 0.57</code></li>
<li>Previous cell state <code>C<sub>t-1</sub> = 0.5</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Updated cell state <code>C<sub>t</sub></code> calculation:</p>
<div class="formula">C<sub>t</sub> = (f<sub>t</sub> * C<sub>t-1</sub>) + (i<sub>t</sub> * Ć<sub>t</sub>) = (0.59 * 0.5) + (0.64 * 0.57) ≈ 0.295 + 0.3648 ≈ 0.6598</div>
<p>The updated cell state is approximately <code>C<sub>t</sub> = 0.6598</code>.</p>
<p>The hidden state update with <code>o<sub>t</sub> = 0.59</code>:</p>
<div class="formula">h<sub>t</sub> = o<sub>t</sub> * tanh(C<sub>t</sub>) ≈ 0.59 * 0.579 ≈ 0.3416</div>
<p>The final hidden state is approximately <code>h<sub>t</sub> = 0.3416</code>.</p>

<h2>7. Why Does LSTM Outperform RNN?</h2>
<p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are both designed to process sequential data. However, LSTMs often outperform RNNs, especially in tasks that require retaining information over long sequences. The following image provides a comparison between RNN and LSTM architectures:</p>

<p class="caption">Figure: Comparison between RNN and LSTM. RNNs have a single "working memory" loop, while LSTMs introduce additional long-term memory to handle information over extended sequences.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<h3>Understanding the Image: RNN vs. LSTM</h3>
<p>The image highlights a fundamental difference in memory structure between RNNs and LSTMs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working Memory in RNN:</strong> On the left, the RNN model only has "working memory," which feeds information from one time step to the next. This structure enables RNNs to capture short-term dependencies but struggles with retaining information across longer sequences due to issues like the vanishing gradient.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Memory in LSTM:</strong> On the right, LSTMs add a separate "long-term memory" component, which acts as a memory cell. This cell can retain important information across longer sequences by mitigating gradient issues, allowing LSTMs to retain past information more effectively over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Theoretical Basis: Why LSTMs Are Superior</h3>
<p>When training RNNs, two key problems arise that limit their ability to capture long-term dependencies: the vanishing gradient problem and the exploding gradient problem. Understanding these issues is crucial to see why LSTMs perform better.</p>
<h4>Vanishing Gradient Problem</h4>
<p>RNNs rely on the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function, which has an output range between [-1, 1] and a derivative range from [0, 1]. As RNNs process sequential data over many time steps, they repeatedly multiply gradients during backpropagation. Over time, these gradients become extremely small due to this repetitive multiplication by numbers less than one. This "shrinking" effect causes earlier layers' gradients to approach zero, meaning that the information from earlier time steps is nearly "forgotten." When the gradient becomes almost zero, weights are no longer updated, leading to poor model learning. This issue is especially problematic in tasks requiring long-term dependencies. Stanford NLP research highlights that this challenge in RNNs makes them unsuitable for tasks needing context from far back in a sequence.</p>
<h4>Exploding Gradient Problem</h4>
<p>The exploding gradient problem is similar to the vanishing gradient problem but with the opposite effect. Here, the gradients are greater than one, so each multiplication increases the gradient exponentially. This "explosion" leads to extremely high gradients, causing instability in the learning process. Large gradient values result in erratic weight updates, making the model difficult to train effectively. Stanford NLP points out that, while techniques like gradient clipping can help manage exploding gradients, they do not solve the underlying issue, especially for very long sequences.</p>
<h4>Long-Term Dependency Issue in RNNs</h4>
<p>Because of these gradient issues, RNNs struggle with long-term dependencies. Imagine trying to fill in the blank in this sentence: "I am a data science student, and I love machine ______." You would naturally fill in "learning." However, if the sentence was more complex, like "I am a data science student pursuing an MS from the University of... and I love machine ______," the network needs to remember context from much earlier in the sequence. RNNs are unable to selectively retain only the important information and thus fail in such cases. LSTMs address this by using gates to selectively retain and forget information, enabling them to handle long-term dependencies more effectively.</p>
<h3>Deep Dive into LSTM Gates</h3>
<p>Each gate in an LSTM network has a specific purpose to help manage the information flow and retain long-term dependencies.</p>
<h4>The Input Gate</h4>
<p>The input gate in an LSTM decides what new information should enter the cell state. It applies a sigmoid activation function to determine which parts of the current input are relevant. Relevant information is then added to the cell state through the tanh function, which scales the data into a range suitable for storage. This process ensures that only necessary information is stored for future reference. The combination of the sigmoid and tanh activations allows the LSTM to control the quantity and quality of new information stored in the memory cell (Stanford NLP).</p>
<h4>The Forget Gate</h4>
<p>The forget gate in an LSTM decides which information from the previous cell state should be "forgotten" or discarded. It receives the previous hidden state and the current input, then applies a sigmoid function to generate probability scores. These scores determine which parts of the cell state are relevant and should be retained and which should be removed. This selective forgetting is key to enabling LSTMs to retain only useful information over long sequences, allowing the network to discard irrelevant details (Stanford NLP).</p>
<h4>Cell State Update Mechanism</h4>
<p>In LSTMs, the cell state update mechanism is more sophisticated than in RNNs. Instead of simply overwriting the previous cell state, the LSTM combines information from the input gate and the forget gate. This allows the LSTM to retain crucial information while discarding irrelevant details, helping it manage long-term dependencies effectively. This selective updating is a unique feature that gives LSTMs an edge over traditional RNNs, as it prevents the loss of important context required for accurate predictions.</p>
<h3>Summary of Key Differences</h3>
<p>To summarize, while RNNs can capture short-term dependencies, they struggle with long-term dependencies due to vanishing and exploding gradients. LSTMs address these limitations by introducing a gated memory cell that can selectively retain important information over extended sequences, making them ideal for tasks requiring long-term memory.</p>
